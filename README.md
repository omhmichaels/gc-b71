#Gitcoin - Bounty 71

## 1. Building RPMs (server)
Install the needed yum packages and generate both source and spec files:
```shell
# bash pre_rpmbuild.sh <version>
# ls -l /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/harmony-one-<version>.spec
# ls -l /root/rpmbuild/SOURCES/harmony-one-<version>.tar
```

Then build the RPM package:
```shell
# rpmbuild -bb /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/harmony-one-<version>.spec
# ls -l /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/harmony-one-<version>-<release>.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

This repo contains RPMs for all v4 versions generated by:
```shell
# for v in $(cat version_list.txt) ; do pre_rpmbuild.sh ${v} && rpmbuild -bb /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/harmony-one-${v}.spec ; done
```

## 2. Populating the yum repository (server)
Add new RPMs to repo:
```shell
# yum install createrepo
# cp /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpms pub/yum/x86_64/.
# cd pub/yum/x86_64
# createrepo .
```

## 3. Testing 'yum install harmony-one' (client)
Copy the repo file:
```shell
# cp harmony-one.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/.
# yum clean all && yum repolist
# yum install harmony-one
```
